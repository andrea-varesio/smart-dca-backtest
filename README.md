## Asset
The default asset is SWDA.MI: iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc).

This can easily be changed with the parameter `-a` or `--asset` followed by the ticker of the security, as listed on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).
You also have the option to use other built-in assets, such as the S&P 500 index (`--sp500`). The complete list can be found in the **Usage** paragraph.

## Multipliers
Smart DCA takes different ranges in which the average asset price falls in, depending on which a different multiplier for the monthly investment is assigned to the corresponding tier.

By default, the set of multipliers is the same for each trial and is generated with increments (by default the increment is 0.25, this can be customized with `-mi` or `--mult-incr`).
The program offers the ability to generate a random set of multiplier for each trial (there is however a ~3% performance hit on total time). This can be achieved by passing the `-rm` or `--rand-mult` parameter.

You can specify the maximum (`-M`, `--max-mult`) and minimum (`-m`, `--min-mult`) multipliers. You can also decide whether or not these boundries are used as limits or actual multipliers, with `-fM`, `--force-max`, and `-fm`, `--force-min`.

## Ranges
The default behavior of this program is to generate an array of 7 tiers with a random range (which falls between -15% and 15%) each, with the `n` (negative) tiers being the ones that have a range assigned that is less than the average investment price. 

However, given that the ranges are randomly generated, it may occur that some are greater than zero, despite the tier. To force the use of negative ranges in negative tiers, you can pass the `-fn` or `--force-neg` parameter.

You also have the option to generate incremental ranges with the `-ir` or `--incr-ranges` parameter. This option will generate 21 combinations of ranges

### Example:

Tier | Ranges (incremental: range 21) | Multiplier (default)
---|---|---
n3 | avg < -15% | 1.75
n2 | -15.0% < avg < -12.5% | 1.5
n1 | -12.5% < avg < -10.0% | 1.25
00 | -10.0% < avg < 10.0% | 1.00
p1 | 10.0% < avg < 12.5% | 0.75
p2 | 12.5 < avg < 15.0% | 0.5
p3 | 15.0% < avg | 0.25

## Updating
The recommended way to update is by cloning the repository, as all the commits are signed with my key.

However, if you prefer, you can also run the program with the `-u` or `--update` parameter to perform an automatic update:

The script will check the updated sha512sum published in `main.py.DIGESTS.asc` and compare it with the hash of the updated version of the program. If it matches, the program will update itself, otherwise the process will stop.

You also have the option to verify the signature of `main.py.DIGESTS.asc` to ensure all the hashes are genuine.
